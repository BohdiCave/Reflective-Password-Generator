## Reflective-Password-Generator

A tool to generate a secure password using 4 groups of characters - lowercase, uppercase, numerical and special - while giving the user a choice of length and of which groups to use in generating the password. 
 
And all the while the user may enjoy viewing a serene lake surface, reflecting along with it, contemplating the things in life that truly matter.
